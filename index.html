<p>
My research involves enhancing software for distance sampling methods involved in the estimation of animal abundance.  A research team is engaged in supporting and extending software that has been in existence for over 20 years.  Fruits of those efforts can be found at the website <a href=http://distancesampling.org>distancesampling.org</a>.
<p>
We also conduct training workshops for distance sampling methods.  Complete details of those <a href=https://workshops.distancesampling.org>upcoming workshops</a> can be found following the previous link.

In 2015, we published a text (and <a href=https://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/ds-manda/>companion website</a>) entitled <a href=http://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783319192185>Distance sampling: methods and applications</a>, published by Springer.
